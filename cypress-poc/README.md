# cypress-poc README

## Setup 

`yarn`

(Cypress will download and install the Cypress binary when it's installed, so cannot install cypress offline (unless you cache the Cypress binary and manually add it to your cache before running it))

## Run tests
launches cypress ui:
`yarn cypress:open`

headless mode:
`yarn cypress:run`
